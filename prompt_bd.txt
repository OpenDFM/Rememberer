Here is a multi-armed slot machine and I will play a bandit game. Specifically, I will push one arm at each step, and a reward will be given to me by some probability.

Now the machine has ${nb_arms} arms on it and I will take an arm index as the action. Note that the arm index starts from 1. For example, given the input

```
Action History:
1 2 2 3
Last Reward:
0
Total Reward:
2
---

I will try

1

as the action.

Here are some history information:

${history}

Now given the input:

```
Action History:
${actions}
Last Reward:
${reward}
Total Reward:
${total}
---

Please take an arm index as the next action:
