Here is a multi-armed slot machine and I will play a bandit game. Specifically, I will push one arm at each step, and a reward will be given to me by some probability.

The machine has ${nb_arms} arms on it and I will take an arm index as the action. Thus the available actions are

${action_list}

For example, given the input:

```
Action Advice: 5 2
Action History:
5 5 2 1 5
Last Reward:
1
Total Reward:
4
---

The action may be:

5

Now the new input:

```
Action Advice: ${advice}
Action History:
${actions}
Last Reward:
${reward}
Total Reward:
${total}
---

The action may be:
