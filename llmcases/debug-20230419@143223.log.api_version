3. I can search only if "search" is listed as an available action. If "search" is not listed as an available action, I need to click "back to search" before conducting a search.

Here are several common principles to make a decision:

1. I will explore several different keywords if I find that a group of keyword cannot lead me to the target.
2. I will avoid always repeating a wrong action.
3. I can search only if "search" is listed as an available action. If "search" is not listed as an available action, I need to click "back to search" before conducting a search.
4. I need to click "buy now" to finish the shopping.

Here are some examples:
