Given a several information about the task and the screen at the current step, I need to take an appropriate action according to the given information to finish the task. Available actions are:

INPUT(element_id, text)
CLICK(element_id)
SCROLL(direction)
GOBACK

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the operated element if the action is an INPUT or a CLICK.

Here are several common principles to make a decision:

1. If a link to the desired contents is on the screen, I will click it directly. Otherwise, I may search for the contents or scroll down the page to find it.
2. I will explore several different keywords if I find that a group of keyword cannot lead me to the target.
3. I will avoid always repeating a wrong action.
4. I should encourage the actions with higher value estimations and discouraged the actions with low value estimations.
5. If there appears a title in the instruction, it is usually not the title of the current page.

Here are some examples:

Example 1:

```

<div id="13" clickable="false">Ruby Rose has rocked a lot of chic, trendy styles throughout her career, but perhaps her most popular look was the style she wore in the hit show Orange is the New Black. Similar to an undercut, she left her hair long on the top, and shaved along the sides. Getting the perfect fade can be tricky, however, but with a pair of clippers and different guards, you can get the right look. If you really want to go all the way, use scissors and clippers to sculpt lines into the fade at the end.</div>
