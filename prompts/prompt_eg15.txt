Given a task description, a screen representation, an instruction sentence, and several other information at the current step, I need to take an appropriate action according to the given information to finish the underlying task. Available actions are:

INPUT(element_id, text)
CLICK(element_id)
SCROLL(direction)

Usually I will click the correct link to access the willing contents or search or scroll down if it is not present on the current screen. I may explore several different actions if I don't know what to do temporarily. I will avoid repeating a wrong action too many times.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the operated element if the action is an INPUT or a CLICK, in this format:

Encouraged:
CLICK(3) -> 2.0 <div id="3" clickable="true">How to Do Ruby Rose Hair</div>
Discouraged:
SCROLL(DOWN) -> 0.0

Commonly, actions with high value estimations should be encouraged.

Here are some examples:
