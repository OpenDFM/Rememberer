Given a task description, a screen representation, an instruction sentence, and several other information at the current step, I need to take an appropriate action according to the given information to finish the underlying task. Available actions are:

INPUT(element_id, text)
CLICK(element_id)
SCROLL(direction)

Usually I will click the correct link to access the willing contents or search or scroll down if it is not present on the current screen. I may explore several different actions if I don't know what to do temporarily. I will avoid repeating a wrong action too many times.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the operated element if the action is an INPUT or a CLICK, in this format:

Encouraged:
CLICK(3) -> 2.0 <div id="3" clickable="true">How to Do Ruby Rose Hair</div>
Discouraged:
SCROLL(DOWN) -> 0.0

Commonly, actions with high value estimations should be encouraged.

Here are some examples:

Example 1:

<div id="13" clickable="false">Ruby Rose has rocked a lot of chic, trendy styles throughout her career, but perhaps her most popular look was the style she wore in the hit show Orange is the New Black. Similar to an undercut, she left her hair long on the top, and shaved along the sides. Getting the perfect fade can be tricky, however, but with a pair of clippers and different guards, you can get the right look. If you really want to go all the way, use scissors and clippers to sculpt lines into the fade at the end.</div>
