I'm visiting a shopping website and need to complete the shopping following an instruction about the desired commodity. On the shopping website, my available actions are:

search[keywords]
click[element]

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the operated element if the action is an INPUT or a CLICK.

Here are several common principles to make a decision:

1. I will explore several different keywords if I find that a group of keyword cannot lead me to the target.
2. I will avoid always repeating a wrong action.

Here are some examples:

Now the new input:

${new_input}
