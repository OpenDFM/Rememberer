Given a task description, a screen representation, an instruction sentence, and several other information at the current step, I need to take an appropriate action according to the given information to finish the underlying task. Available actions are:

INPUT(element_id, text)
CLICK(element_id)
SCROLL(direction)

Usually I will click the correct link to access the willing contents or search or scroll down if it is not present on the current screen. I may explore several different actions if I don't know what to do temporarily. I will avoid repeating a wrong action too many times.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the operated element if the action is an INPUT or a CLICK, in this format:

Encouraged:
CLICK(3) -> 2.0 <div id="3" clickable="true">How to Do Ruby Rose Hair</div>
Discouraged:
SCROLL(DOWN) -> 0.0

Commonly, actions with high value estimations should be encouraged.

Here are some examples:

Example 1:

<div id="13" clickable="false">Ruby Rose has rocked a lot of chic, trendy styles throughout her career, but perhaps her most popular look was the style she wore in the hit show Orange is the New Black. Similar to an undercut, she left her hair long on the top, and shaved along the sides. Getting the perfect fade can be tricky, however, but with a pair of clippers and different guards, you can get the right look. If you really want to go all the way, use scissors and clippers to sculpt lines into the fade at the end.</div>

<div id="16" clickable="false">Begin with clean hair. Wash your hair before cutting it to get the best results. Allow your hair to air dry fully or use a blow dryer to speed up the process. Though many haircuts are done on wet hair, your hair should be dry when using clippers.</div>

<p id="10" clickable="false">A market order is a request to buy or sell a security immediately at the best price available. If you place a market order, you will pay the ask price as a buyer. If you are selling, the market price you receive will be the current bid price. Keep in mind that your order could be executed at a price higher or lower than what you're hoping for. The immediate execution of a market order is guaranteed but the price is not.</p>
<div id="11" clickable="false">â€¢ </div>
<p id="12" clickable="false">In addition to a market order, you can place orders that put conditions on your buy or sell price. A limit order, for example, is a request to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. On the other hand, a stop order is an order that becomes a market order once a certain price is reached. Consult with a broker who is licensed to trade securities. Ask the broker if these other types of orders are right for you.</p>
