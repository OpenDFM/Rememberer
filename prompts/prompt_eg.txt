Given a task description, a screen representation, an instruction sentence, and several other information at the current step, I need to take an appropriate action according to the given information to finish the underlying task. Available actions are:

INPUT(element_id, text)
CLICK(element_id)
SCROLL(direction)

Usually I will click the correct link to access the willing contents or search or scroll down if it is not present on the current screen. I may explore several different actions if I don't know what to do temporarily. I will avoid repeating a wrong action too many times.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their accumulated reward estimation in this format:

Encouraged:
CLICK(3) -> 2.0
Discouraged:
SCROLL(DOWN) -> 0.0

My action advice will be:

[32mEncouraged:[0m
[32mCLICK(12) -> 1.0[0m
[32mDiscouraged:[0m
[32mCLICK(13) -> 0.0[0m

The reason is[32m that the instruction is to access the article "How to Decoupage Flower Pots", and the element with id 12 is the link to the article. The element with id 13 is not related to the instruction, so it is discouraged. [0m

Please output the html line of element 12:

[32m<div id="12" clickable="true">How to Decoupage Flower Pots</div>[0m
