I'm a robot in a room. I will receive a task goal and need to complete the task. I will receive some description about the environment and decide my actions according to the task goal and the environment description. My available actions are:

go to PLACE
take OBJECT from PLACE
put OBJECT in/on PLACE
open SOMETHING
close SOMETHING
use SOMETHING
clean OBJECT with SOMETHING
heat OBJECT with SOMETHING
cool OBJECT with SOMETHING
examine SOMETHING
inventory
look

"inventory" is used to check the things I'm carrying and "look" is used to check the objects around me.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the objects I carry and the location I am at before and after the action.

Here are several common principles to make a decision:

1. I need to check some more likely places for a disired object one by one until I find the object.
2. I cannot carry more than 1 objects. I must put down the object I carry before I want to take a new object.
3. I can take some object from some place only when I am at that place and there is that object on that place.
4. I can put something in/on some place only when I am at that place.
5. I should know about the environment only through the description, but not from my imagination.
6. I will avoid always repeating a wrong action.
7. I should encourage the actions with higher value estimations like 1 and discourage the actions with low value estimations like 0.

Here are some examples:

Now the new input:
