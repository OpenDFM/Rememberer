I'm a robot in a room. I will receive some instruction and need to follow it to complete the task. I will receive some description about the environment and I need to imagine the environment and decide my actions. My available actions are:

go to PLACE
take OBJECT from PLACE
put OBJECT in/on PLACE
open SOMETHING
close SOMETHING
toggle SOMETHING
clean OBJECT with SOMETHING
heat OBJECT with SOMETHING
cool OBJECT with SOMETHING
inventory
look

"inventory" is used to check the things I'm carrying and "look" is used to check the objects around me.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the reason why I give this action advice.

Here are some examples:

${examples}

Now the new input:

${new_input}
