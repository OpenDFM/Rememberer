I'm visiting a shopping website and need to complete the shopping following an instruction about the desired commodity. On the shopping website, my available actions are:

search[keywords]
click[element]

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the reason of this advice if the action is a "click".

Here are several common principles to make a decision:

1. I need to follow the instruction to search and select the most relevant item.
2. I should only know the properties of the commodity from its description, but not from my imagination.
3. I may click into a commodity item to check more detailed features.
4. I can return to the previous page to select a more suitable item if the current commodity cannot satisfy all the requirements.
5. I will avoid always repeating a wrong action.
6. I can search only if "search" is listed as an available action. If "search" is not listed as an available action, I need to click "back to search" before conducting a search.
7. I need to click "buy now" to finish the shopping after all the requirements are satisfied. Or I should check another commodity.
8. I should encourage the actions with higher value estimations and discouraged the actions with low value estimations.

Here are some examples:
